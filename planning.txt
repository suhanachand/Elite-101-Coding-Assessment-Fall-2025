PSA: i just copied this over from my google docs, since i didn't planning directly on vscode


Each book has:
id → a unique thing like "B1"
title → name of the book
author → who wrote it
genre → like Fantasy, Mystery, etc.
available → True/False if it’s checked out
due_date → when it’s due, or None
checkouts → how many times it’s been borrowed
  -use this to understand how to use lists in code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x8oN6FtpLo&t=3s

quick helpers: 
_today() → just gives today’s date
_find_book(book_id) → looks up a book by ID so I don’t have to repeat this code everywhere,
and i remember learning abt it in class

1.function view_available_books():
    make an empty list 'available'
    for each book in library_books:
        if book is available:
            add "ID | Title by Author" to 'available'
    return 'available'
basically just looping through and printing out the free books.


2.function search_books(term):
    make the term lowercase
    create empty list 'results'
    for each book in library_books:
        if term is in book["author"] (lowercase) or book["genre"] (lowercase):
            add book to 'results'
    return 'results'
this way I don’t have to type exact capitalization, makes searching easier.
works p much

3. function check_book(book_id):
    book = _find_book(book_id)
    if no book found:
        return "No book with that ID."
    if book isn’t available:
        return "Book is already checked out, here’s the due date."
        #lwk just use: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#f-strings since it tell me
        how to make more formal and functional
    # book is free, so checkout
    due_date = today + 14 days
    book["available"] = False
    book["due_date"] = due_date
    book["checkouts"] += 1
    return "Book checked out! Due on X."
super simple logic, just mark it and give feedback.
done!

4. a. 
    function return_book(book_id):
    book = _find_book(book_id)
    if no book found:
        return "No book with that ID."
    if book is already available:
        return "Book is already returned."
    book["available"] = True
    book["due_date"] = None
    return "Book returned. Thanks!"

    b.
    function list_overdue_books():
        make empty list 'overdue'
        today = current date
        for each book in library_books:
            if book is checked out and has a due date:
                if due date < today:
                    add book to 'overdue'
        return 'overdue'
    just checking which books are late.

    level 4 works but im getting some errors, i might need to fix my helpers
